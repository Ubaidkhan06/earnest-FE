Objective:Build a simple task management application using React for the frontend, Express.js
for the backend, and a SQL database (e.g., SQL, PSQL, SQL lite, etc) for data storage.
Requirements:

● Create a RESTful API for managing tasks.
● Implement endpoints for:Retrieving all tasks
● Adding a new task
● Updating a task's status (completed or not)

Database (SQL):
2. Create a "tasks" table with the following columns:
● id (auto-incrementing primary key)
● title (string)
● description (string)
● completed (boolean)


3. Frontend (React):

● Display a list of tasks with their titles, descriptions, and completion status.
● Provide a form to add a new task.
● Include a button to mark a task as completed or not.
● Implement a button to delete a task.
Additional Requirements:
● Use state management in React to handle the list of tasks.
● Ensure proper error handling for API requests.
Notes:
● Focus on code readability, structure, and best practices.
● You can use any additional libraries or tools you find appropriate.
● Include instructions on how to set up and run the application
